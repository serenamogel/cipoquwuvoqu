Gohan is a half saiyan and had a tail but Trunks, Goten, and Bulla had <b>no tails</b> but were also half saiyan.</span></span><h2>How come Goten and Trunks don't have tails?</h2>Think about it this way; Gohan, Goten, and Trunks are each half-saiyan, half-human. They each have one fully Saiyan parent, with the genes for a tail, and one fully human parent, with no tail genes. So they've got a 50/50 chance of having or not having a tail.<h2>Why does Bulla have no tail?</h2>The official answer is: Toriyama didn't like drawing them, so he permanently got rid of them.<h2>Do half Saiyans have tails?</h2>Gohan must've gotten lucky with his tail, as he's the only half-saiyan on Earth with a tail. We know as a fact that pure-blooded saiyans (from Universe 7 that is) are always born with tails, so that biology must get a bit messed up when a saiyan has a child with a human.<h2>Do u6 Saiyans have tails?</h2>Saiyans native to Universe 6 do not possess tails due to the evolutionary process they underwent in their universe, as explained by Cabba in the manga, though in the anime, Cabba has never heard nor has knowledge of Saiyan tails.<h2>Why do Goten and Trunks NOT have tails? THE REAL ANSWER!</h2><p></p><h2>Can Universe 6 Saiyans go ssj4?</h2>The simple fact is that they've long LOST THEIR TAILS DURING THEIR RACE'S EVOLUTION PROCESS.<h2>What happened to Goten tail?</h2>Obviously half breeds can have a tail like Gohan, but Trunks and Goten didn't. Chi Chi and Bulma had them removed at birth to prevent an Oozaru crisis. In other words, Akira forgot about them.<h2>Does yamcha have a tail?</h2>Just as Goku is about to crush Bulma, pinned by some rubble, Yamcha comes to the rescue and grabs his tail, stunning him long enough for Puar to transform into a giant pair of scissors and cut the tail off, returning Goku to his normal state.<h2>Does Bulla have a tail?</h2>Like these two, Bulla too was born without a tail. The idea that tailless Saiyans are more powerful goes along with the conception idea where the stronger the Saiyan, the stronger the child. Not having a tail is a big plus!<h2>Are all Saiyans born with tails?</h2>Of course, Dragon Ball fans would go on to learn that every Saiyan in Universe 7 is born with a tail. The appendage is a took which Saiyans use their entire lives, and it even allows them to tap into their Great Ape power on full moons.<h2>Is Trunks a half Saiyan?</h2>Dragon Ball: 5 Reasons Future Trunks Is The Best Half Saiyan (& 5 Why It's Gohan) Their half-Saiyan status hasn't held either of them back, but, between Future Trunks and Gohan which is Dragon Ball's best hybrid hero? After the fall of Planet Vegeta, only a few Saiyans remain in the universe.<h2>Is Granolah half Saiyan?</h2>For those who have been wondering just who Granolah is, it appears that he is not in fact a Saiyan but is rather an alien that was horribly affected by the Saiyan race's universe conquering ways under the guidance of the alien despot Freeza.<h2>Are half Saiyans stronger?</h2>Yes, without a doubt half blood Saiyans are stronger than full blood Saiyans because even Goku had to admit that Gohan was stronger than him and Vegeta in Dragon Ball Super.<h2>Who is future Goten?</h2>Future Goten (孫悟天（未来）) is the son of Future Goku & Future Chi-Chi and thus the younger brother of Future Gohan, he was born after Goku's death by the heart problem, since Goku wanted Chi-Chi to have the best of him before he passes away.<h2>Why is Goten small in Dragon Ball super?</h2>Originally Answered: Why did Trunks and Goten become smaller in DBS? People liked the kid versions of them, so Akira decided to make them younger apparently. A lot of it is to do with the merchandise tastes.<h2>Can saiyans go Super Saiyan with a tail?</h2>ALL the saiyans in universe 6 are tail-less, having officially evolved past the need for them, and Cabba manages to go Super Saiyan in a fight against Vegeta. Now for that discussion about possible outliers. Bardock. The only pure-blooded saiyan with a tail we ever see going super saiyan.<h2>How did Yamcha get his scars?</h2>He got his scars from his battle with cybor tao during the gap between the 22nd and 23rd budokai.<h2>Are saiyans monkeys?</h2>Sayains are space monkeys. Saiyans are non-human aliens, so to suggest any common ancestry with any species on Earth is unjustifiable. Even if they were human, a human with a tail would still not be a monkey or ape.<h2>Did kid Trunks have a tail?</h2>Gohan is a half saiyan and had a tail but Trunks, Goten, and Bulla had no tails but were also half saiyan.<h2>Does Piccolo still fused with nail?</h2>Piccolo reveals to Goku that once Namekians fuse together, there is no going back. So yes, Nail is still fused with Piccolo.<h2>Is Goten stronger than Gohan?</h2>Goten is stronger than Gohan and Goku were at HIS AGE. Goku trained almost his whole life, and Gohan was the first one to achieve Super Saiyan 2 and had a lot of potential.<h2>Who removed Gohan's tail?</h2>1 Son Gohan: Cut Off By Vegeta<p>With the intensity of the battle against Vegeta pushing everyone to their limits, Gohan's tail suddenly regrows after his personal fight with the Elite Saiyan. Gohan gazes up at the artificial moon Vegeta created and begins to wreak havoc.</p><h2>Why don't they wish back the Saiyans?</h2>TL;DR Vegeta was never too interested in any Saiyan's wellbeing but his own / after his 'change of heart' he wouldn't have been able to overcome the combined forces of the other Super Saiyans for a selfish wish, even if he had wanted to make one.<h2>Why didn't Goku revive the Saiyans?</h2>This may be due to the Saiyans being a warrior race, seeing defeat as a deep dishonor, meaning Vegeta likely felt that his fallen brethren were not worthy to resurrect, outright dismissing the possibility of reviving Raditz with the Dragon Balls when Nappa suggested so in passing after Raditz's death.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8Oim2afn6myr3nHmq2eZaSWtq2%2F</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./doug-fieger.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Doug Fieger</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pokemon-go-should-you-get-the-spreading-cheer-community-day-special-research-ticket.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pokmon Go Spreading Cheer Community Day Special Research Ticket - Is it Worth it?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-movie-review-2023.html>Emily movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-george-net-worth.html>Paul George Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-gentry.html>Who is Teddy Gentry?
