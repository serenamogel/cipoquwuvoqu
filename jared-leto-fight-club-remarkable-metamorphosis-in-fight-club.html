Transformation</span></h2><p>Leto was cast as Angel Face by director David Fincher, who was impressed by his previous work in films.</p><p>Fincher wanted Leto to play a character who was “beautiful and perfect” but also “vulnerable and naive”.</p><p>To achieve this look, Leto had to undergo a physical transformation that involved losing weight, bleaching his hair, and shaving his eyebrows.</p><p>He also had to learn how to fight and endure the brutal scenes of violence in the film.</p><h2><span id=Cared_Leto_Fight_club_Beating_Scene>Cared Leto Fight club Beating Scene</span></h2><p>One of the most iconic scenes in Fight Club is when the narrator (Edward Norton) beats up Angel Face out of jealousy and resentment.</p><p>Norton later revealed that he actually hit Leto in the face for real, causing him to bleed and swell.</p><p>Leto said that he did not mind the pain, as he wanted to be authentic and committed to his role.</p><p>He also said that he enjoyed working with Norton and <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, who played Tyler Durden, the leader of the fight club and the narrator’s alter ego.</p><p><img decoding=async
