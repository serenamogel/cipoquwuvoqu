Beyoncé's two-hour performance which combined performers from HBCUs, surprise reunions and her greatest hits. Not only did Beyoncé impress with her performance and vocal chops, but as the first Black woman to headline Coachella, she also seized the opportunity to showcase African American culture in a way it had never been done before.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Beyoncé had a history of surprise Coachella performances</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Beyoncé long had family ties to the festival held in the desert in Indio, California.

But there was another due date looming: Beyoncé had announced she was pregnant with twins, and according to doctor’s orders, she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/arts/music/beyonce-coachella-cancel-pregnant.html#:%7e:text=In%20a%20statement%2C%20Beyonc%C3%A9's%20company,statement%20said%2C%20according%20to%20The" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="had to pull out" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">had to pull out</a> of the long-anticipated performance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fans who already had their tickets were disappointed.

It's like a different headspace. Me getting the weight off, was so much easier than getting back in shape and my body feeling comfortable.”</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">She was intimately involved with every detail of the planning</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With her physical transformation in the works, the Houston-born star then focused on the performance itself. And she didn’t want it to just be another flashy performance — this time she wanted to put some meaning behind it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The singer had “always dreamed of going to an HBCU [Historically Black College/University],” as she said in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/arts/music/homecoming-beyonce-facts.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Homecoming class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Homecoming</a>. She had visited Prairie View A&M University and rehearsed at Texas Southern University, and her father had gone to Nashville’s Fisk University — and she always loved their Battle of the Bands marching band showcases. “I grew up seeing those shows and that being the highlight of my year,” Beyoncé explained.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">So she set off to recreate the experience exactly the way she remembered. “I personally selected each dancer, every light, the material on the steps, the height of the pyramid, the shape of the pyramid,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/arts/music/homecoming-beyonce-facts.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explained class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">explained</a>. “Every tiny detail had an intention.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She paid special attention to portraying each element accurately. “I wanted a Black orchestra...I wanted the steppers. I needed different characters, I didn't want us all doing the same thing,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2019/04/22/715985010/homecoming-from-the-bleachers-members-of-beyonc-s-marching-band-look-back data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=explained class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">explained</a> further. And their talents even impressed the chart-topper. “The things that these young people can do with their bodies and the music they can play… it’s just not right. It’s just so much damn swag.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Beyoncé performing during Coachella in April 2018</p><span data-node-id=24>"></span><h2 data-node-id=25 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">The set honored Black culture and had several surprise performances</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For her performance, Beyoncé's already iconic library of hits was reimagined through the lens of an HBCU marching band halftime show.
