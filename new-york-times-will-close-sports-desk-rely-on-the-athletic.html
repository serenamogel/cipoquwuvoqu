Sulzberger, chairman of the New York Times Company.</p><p>“For 18 months, The New York Times has left its sports staff twisting in the wind,” said the letter, which was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">obtained by the Washington Post</a> on Sunday.</p><p>“We have watched the company buy a competitor with hundreds of sportswriters and weigh decisions about the future of sports coverage at The Times without, in many instances, so much as a courtesy call, let alone any solicitation of our expertise,” the letter continued.</p><p>“The company’s efforts appear to be coming to a head, with The Times pursuing a full-scale technological migration of The Athletic to The Times’s platforms and the threat that the company will effectively shut down our section,” the letter added.</p><p>The Times <a href=#>acquired The Athletic 18 months ago</a> with the goal of integrating the site into its bundle of offerings that includes recipes and games.</p><p>But The Athletic is currently losing money and has set a goal to turn a profit by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>“We intend to utilize The Athletic — which has among the largest sports newsrooms in the world — to provide Times readers with a greater abundance of sports coverage than ever before,” said Sulzberger and CEO&nbsp;Meredith Kopit Levien&nbsp;in a separate note to staff.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Subscription sports website The Athletic was acquired by the Times last year for $550 million. <span class=credit>The Athletic</span></figure><p>The Athletic employs around 400 staffers in North America and Europe, and as of last year, was hit by layoffs of between 40 and 50 writers and editors amid economic headwinds facing the media and advertising industries, the Washington Post reported.</p><p>Just last month, the <a href=#>site shed 20 writers and reassigned 20 others to different beats</a>, according to the publication.</p><p>Despite having 3.3 million subscribers, The Athletic lost $7.8 million last quarter, on top of losing $12.6 million in the second quarter last year and $6.8 million in February and March of last year, the Times has reported in public filings.</p><p>Since the acquisition, there has been notable overlap in sports coverage between the sports department and The Athletic, which, according to the Washington Post, prompted Kahn to tell sports staffers this year that the Times had more reporters covering sports than any other topic and that there needed to be more integration.</p><p>Amid speculation on Friday that the Times’ sports section would be shuttered, a spokeswoman for the Times told The Post:</p><p>“We’ve had conversations since we bought The Athletic about what it means for the future of our sports coverage. We’ve rolled out some changes, such as including Athletic stories on the&nbsp;nytimes.com&nbsp;home screen. As with any coverage area, we have been closely evaluating how to deliver the best possible sports journalism for our growing audience. We’ll update when we have more to share.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Since being acquired by the Times, The Athletic has undergone a restructuring that led to about 40 to 50 layoffs. <span class=credit>The Athletic</span></figure><p>The rep denied that managers had been telling reporters that they would be asked to leave the company or join The Athletic, despite buzz suggesting an impending shakeup.</p><p>Complicating matters regarding any downsizing is the fact that the Times is unionized and The Athletic is not.</p><p>A rep from the Times’ union, the NewsGuild of New York, did not immediately comment.</p><p>According to CNN, the newspaper’s union blasted the move, saying sports staffers were given “virtually no notice of this change.”</p><p>The NewsGuild told the outlet it intends to fight what it called a “flagrant attempt at union-busting” and will work with sports reporters to uphold their rights as outlined by their union contracts.</p><p>Times staffers are working under a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new union contract that was ratified this year</a>.</p><p>Sunday’s letter spoke to that issue, stating that leadership promised there would be no layoffs in the Times newsroom and also that the company acknowledged “that the New York Times Guild has jurisdiction over newsroom jobs and that any plan for Athletic employees to perform bargaining unit work must be done in accordance with our union contract.”</p><p>The letter then asked: “Do those promises still hold?”</p><p>The letter references the history of the sports department, dating from its coverage of the first Olympics in Athens in 1896.</p><p>Columnists Red Smith, Arthur Daley and Dave Anderson won Pulitzers, as did John Branch in 2013 for feature writing.</p><p>The letter also highlights the sports division’s big scoops and leading coverage on issues such as concussions in football, doping in horse racing, Russia’s detention of Brittney Griner and the injection of billions of dollars from the Middle East into global sports.</p><p>Among the signers of the letter were prominent baseball and NFL writers Tyler Kepner and Ken Belson; Jenny Vrentas, an investigative reporter who has written extensively about NFL quarterback Deshaun Watson; and Juliet Macur, who last year chronicled the harrowing journey of a female soccer player out of Afghanistan, the Washington Post said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmamhfo7K4edioqaRlpJ66pr%2BMsKClpF2YubC%2FxGaqqaeiqcBusMSsomaqlaHGbrvNZquhnV2Wwam4xK2gnGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./was-amirah-dyme-arrested-find-more-about-ray-hushpuppi-girlfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Was Amirah Dyme Arrested?
