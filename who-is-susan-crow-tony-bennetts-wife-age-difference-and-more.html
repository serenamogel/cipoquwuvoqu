She is in her mid-fifties and was Bennett’s full-time caregiver before he passed away. She was born in San Francisco on September 9, 1966.</p><p data-characters=169 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>She attended Fordham University and Columbia University, according to reports, and worked as an administrative assistant at Merrill Lynch before she moved into teaching.</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>The couple has no children together, and she’s about forty years younger than her late husband. Bennett is also survived by four children from his two previous wives.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>She started a non-profit, Exploring the Arts (ETA), with her husband in 1999, as well as launching a management company named Creative Artists Management.</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Bennett described meeting Crow in his 2016 book Just Getting Started, when her mother wanted a photo with the singer backstage.</p><p>“As fate would have it, [Susan’s mother] was pregnant at the time with… Susan! It’s a photo we all laugh about, knowing the incredible turn of events that followed.”</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=153 data-injectable=false>The implications of that aside, the couple reportedly met when Crow was in her 20s and Bennett was in his 60s. He elaborated on that in the book as well.</p><p>“When she was nineteen she had tickets to see me perform at the Masonic Temple in San Francisco and she put in a request to say hello backstage after the show, probably not expecting a response. The request was sent to me, and it tickled me that someone of her age was so devoted to my music. I not only agreed to say hello to her backstage, but asked her to be my date for the evening, and that’s how it really all began … foreshadowed by a backstage photo taken in 1966!”</p><p data-characters=147 data-current-count=147 data-injectable=false>Crow <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke with</a> journalist Anderson Cooper for an interview on 60 Minutes and revealed that Tony was unaware that he had Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=false>“He recognizes me, thank goodness, his children, you know, we are blessed in a lot of ways. He’s very sweet. He doesn’t know he has it (Alzheimer’s disease),” she said. “I know that his hippocampus, which is the Grand Central Station of memories — and the conduit through which we retrieve memories as well as lay down memories is not working very well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmq6Worq95wqumsGWkpLu6ecGepaedpKnAbsPIn5xmmZeaeqW1xZ%2Bcq52emLJurc2dZKanopp8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./allison-and-marie-jose-benitez-found-or-missing-are-they-dead-or-alive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Allison and Marie-Jos Benitez: Found or Missing?
