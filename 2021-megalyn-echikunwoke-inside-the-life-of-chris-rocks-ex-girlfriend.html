Well, for us, that woman will surely be Megalyn Echikunwoke. The American actress is a gifted movie star who is so adept at her craft that she has become one of the highly admired Hollywood thespians of the last decade. She has starred in several blockbuster feature films and TV series, winning lots of fans who now follow her every move on social media.</p><p>As an actress, she is now best known for her portrayal of Nicole Palmer on 24, an American action-drama television series that became very popular around the world. She is also known for her work on Like Family, an American sitcom in which she played Danika Ward as well as CSI: Miami, an American police procedural drama TV series which saw her playing the main role of Dr. Tara Price. Disregarding her career, she is also known for her relationship with Chris Rock, the star comedian. Some have even assumed it is the major reason she is famous, this is not true as you will soon learn.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-look-at-megalyn-echikunwokes-life-before-she-met-chris></span><strong>A Look At Megalyn Echikunwoke’s Life Before She Met Chris</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Megalyn Echikunwoke was born on the 28th day of May in the year 1983 in Spokane, a city in Spokane County in Washington, USA. Her father died when she was young, so she was raised by her mother on the Navajo Indian reservation in Chinle, Arizona. The actress’s father has been identified as Onigwe Versato Echikunwoke and her mother’s name has been given as Anita Laurie. She has two siblings; a brother and a sister with whom she grew up in Chinle. Her brother is Miki Echikunwoke and her sister’s name has been revealed to be Misty Echikunwoke. The siblings are quite fond of each other.</p><p>The actress has Nigerian, German, and English roots. Yes, even though she is an American woman, she also has Nigerian roots. This is because her father, Onigwe Versato Echikunwoke, was a Nigerian Igbo man. According to sources, her grandfather was a Nigerian tribal leader of the Igbos and this means that she has royal blood flowing through her. However, the actress also has English, Irish, and German roots through her mother, Anita Laurie.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=no-chris-rock-didnt-make-her-famous></span><b>No, Chris Rock Didn’t Make Her Famous</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Megalyn Echikunwoke was still a little girl when her talent was discovered. The actress had gone to a Summer Art camp when she was just 14 years old and displayed her acting talent to the amazement of all and this soon caught the attention of scouts present at the camp. They reached out to her and this was the beginning of great things for her in Hollywood. She started going for auditions soon after she was discovered at the Summer Art Camp and the very next year when she was 15 years old, she scored her first role on TV.</p><p>She kick-started her acting career in 1998 when she was just 15 years old after she was cast as Elizabeth in Creature, a TV Mini-Series. The same year, she appeared on The Steve Harvey Show. She then made her feature film debut in 1999 by playing the role of Lauren in Funny Valentines, a drama movie. In 2001, she scored her first regular role on Spyder Games, a TV Series in which she starred as Cherish Pardee. Her role on Spyder Games made her popular. The same year in 2001, she scored the role of Nicole Palmer in the globally famous series, 24, before starring as Shannon Cross in B.S., a TV Movie. By this time, her reputation as an actress of note was growing and she was gaining lots of fans to herself.</p><p>In 2003, she joined the cast of Like Family, an American sitcom in which she played the main role of Danika Ward. It was the same year that she played Vaughne in an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, another TV Series. In 2004, she won even more admiration when she joined the cast of That ’70s Show to play Angie Barnett. The actress continued her exploits in Hollywood in 2006 when she was cast as Isabelle Tyler in The 4400, a science fiction TV Series. She played the main role across 25 episodes from 2006 to 2007. She also featured in Camjackers, a comedy movie in which she played Sista Strada Cast.</p><p>Over the years, she has scored other main roles in movies and series including CSI: Miami in 2008, 90210 in 2011, House of Lies and Made in Jersey in 2012, Electric Slide and Mind Games in 2014. So from the foregoing, it is obvious that she charted her part to fame, Chris Rock had nothing to do with it.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-former-couple-only-started-dating-in-2015></span><strong>The Former Couple Only Started Dating in 2015</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Megalyn Echikunwoke was in a relationship with Chris Rock, one of the most popular comedians in America. They were together for a good while and appeared very happy with each other’s company. Their relationship caused quite a stir among their fans especially when it was announced.</p><p>Rumors that the couple was having a romantic affair began to spread in 2015 when fans started noticing that they were attending occasions together and were even sharing photos of each other. The couple finally made their relationship public in 2016 to the admiration of their many fans.</p><p>Megalyn was very much in love with Chris Rock as he is with her. They were seen together in public many times and publicly displayed their affection for each other. Because of this, it was quite a surprise when it emerged in March 2020 that they are no longer an item.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-they-fell-apart-and-how-megalyn-has-been-coping-with-the-breakup></span><strong>Why They Fell Apart and How Megalyn Has Been Coping With The Breakup</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>So far, nothing has been established in reference to the reason why the former couple parted ways. But according to reports, the breakup happened a few months before it came to limelight, and was a peaceful one.</p><p>It is claimed that the couple parted ways because the comedian was unwilling to settle down for something serious. Apparently, he is still troubled by his divorce from Malaak Compton-Rock, who was his wife for 18 years.</p><p>Possibly out of mutual respect for what they had, Megalyn Echikunwoke and Chris Rock have refrained from discussing why they decided to split. Both of them are yet to be linked to other partners but have kept up with their careers. For Megalyn, she continues to play her main role as Edie Palmer in the drama series&nbsp;Almost Family.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=megalyn-echikunwokes-career-has-been-financially-rewarding></span><strong>Megalyn Echikunwoke’s Career Has Been Financially Rewarding</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no doubt that Megalyn Echikunwoke has been able to rake in lots of money for herself over the years with her incredible work on screen. She has starred in blockbusters that got the world talking and has won the admiration of millions of fans, apparently making money in the process.</p><p>At the moment, the actress’s net worth has been pegged at about $3 million by celebrity wealth calculators. While the figure isn’t a petty amount, it is little compared to Rock’s wealth which is estimated at $100 million as of 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35uucSgmKWxnmKypLTIpKynr5%2Bgsm61zaygnZ1dqbWmecuinZ5ln5t6pLTRoqpmqp%2BYuLR5xLFkoKGiobOztcSnm2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aew-dynamite-results-coverage-reactions-highlights-for-november-8-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>AEW Dynamite Results Coverage, Reactions &amp;amp; Highlights For November 8, 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maria-eugenia-suarez-bio-wiki-age-family-husband-movies-tv-shows-and-net-worth-3.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mara Eugenia Surez Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Husband, Movies, TV Shows and Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-movie-review-2023.html>Emily movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-george-net-worth.html>Paul George Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-gentry.html>Who is Teddy Gentry?
