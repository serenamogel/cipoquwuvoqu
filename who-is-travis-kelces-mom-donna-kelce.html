Proving something is in the water in her hometown of Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Donna is also the mother of Jason Kelce, a fellow footballer and center for the Philadelphia Eagles. Donna herself made history in February 2023 by becoming the first mom to ever have her sons compete against each other in a championship game.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>Donna’s role as an NFL cheerleader also made headlines in September 2023, when she was spotted supporting Travis alongside Swift at a game against the Chicago Bears, just as rumors of her son’s romance began surfacing. Swift and Donna appeared together at another game later that month, this time celebrating arm-in-arm as Travis took on the New York Jets.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taylor Swift with Donna Kelce in Kansas City to watch Travis Kelce.

In 2022, she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">attended a post-game press conference</a> and asked a question to Travis, who had just thrown the first touchdown pass in his NFL career. In February 2023, Donna <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hinted that her favorite child</a> isn’t necessarily who is best on the field, but Jason, since he is the only son who has given her grandchildren.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>The importance of family is a major throughline in Donna’s life. During an appearance on her sons’ joint podcast, New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce, Donna cited her step-mother, Mary — known as Grandma Murr by the Kelce brothers — as a major influence on her life, especially following her mother’s death. It was Mary who encouraged Donna to vie for the Junior Olympics, where she eventually competed for track and field.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Donna was married to the Kelce brothers’ father, Ed, for 25 years.

She landed her first job at Bank One as an equity writer in 1981, and enrolled in classes at Baldwin Wallace University that same year.

Donna retired in 2021, and now rightfully fills her days as a dedicated full-time NFL mom. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we do know about Donna’s relationship to the Swift fanbase, and while she recognises the pop star’s talent, Donna doesn’t consider herself a Swiftie.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donna has said</a> that she is more a fan of ‘Queen of Funk’ and “I’m Every Woman” singer Chaka Khan, and also considers herself a fan of musical group Earth, Wind & Fire.
