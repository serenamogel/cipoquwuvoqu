Under normal conditions -- meaning the ball wasn't damaged beyond reasonable use, or it didn't wind up in a water hazard or was lost -- a golfer can change golf balls in between holes.</span></span><h2>Can you replace your golf ball on the green?</h2>You can also substitute a different ball any time you are taking relief, including both free and penalty relief. Unless the one-ball Local Rule is in effect, the substituted ball could be any brand. On the putting green however, when you mark and lift your ball, you must replace that same ball to finish out the hole.<h2>Can a pro golfers change balls?</h2>You started with the Pro V1x, so the Pro V1x is what you must use on every stroke. If the "one ball rule" is not in effect, however, golfers may swap out different types of golf balls at any point in a round of golf, so long as the change is made in-between holes rather than during the play of a hole.<h2>Can you clean your ball off the green?</h2>When you lift your ball from the putting green. it may always be cleaned. When you lift your ball from anywhere else it may always be cleaned except when you lift it: To see if it is cut or cracked – cleaning is not allowed.<h2>Does a golfer have to take his own ball out of the hole?</h2>The ball in the hole can be removed by anyone, not just Larry, but there is no penalty for letting this sleeping dog lie. Tom gets no do-over — he counts his stroke and continues to play on. Presumably, next time he'll fish out the offending orb or, better yet, demand that Lazy Larry do so. Got a rules question?<h2>When Can You Change Balls (Substitute) in Golf?</h2><p></p><h2>Can you brush sand off the green?</h2>Yes.

The PGA Tour has no rule preventing pro golfers from using a coloured golf ball.<h2>Why do pro golfers leave the pin in when putting?</h2>He concluded that keeping the pin in prevented some breaking putts from entering the hole, specifically those putts that began to drift away from the hole's center as they approached it. The same putts succeeded every time with the pin out.<h2>Are you allowed to clean your golf ball on the fairway?</h2>A golfer cannot clean their ball in any other situation, including when the ball is in the fairway, when the ball is in the rough, when the ball is in a bunker.<h2>Is drawing a line on a golf ball legal?</h2>Yes, drawing an arrow/line on your golf ball is 100% legal and used by some of the best golfers in the world. Players across the world draw lines, add their initials, and other signature markings to their golf balls.<h2>Can you lie on the green to read a putt?</h2>May I kneel or lie on the green to read a putt?

There will be no penalty incurred.<h2>How many clubs can a golfer carry?</h2>Topic Overview: You are allowed to carry up to 14 clubs for play (but you can have fewer).

The caddie continues to be allowed to replace the player's ball only if the caddie was the one who had lifted or moved the ball.<h2>Can you move wood chips in golf?</h2>Under the Rules of Golf, wood chips are considered loose impediments, which means you can move individual wood chips (see Rule 15.1).<h2>Can you move twigs in golf?</h2>Loose impediments and movable obstructions can be moved anywhere on the golf course, including in bunkers and penalty areas, even when your ball also lies in the bunker or penalty area. If your ball moves when moving a movable obstruction, there is not penalty and you simply replace the ball.<h2>What is the golden rule of golf?</h2>Play the ball as it lies. Don't move, bend, or break anything growing or fixed, except in fairly taking your stance or swing.
