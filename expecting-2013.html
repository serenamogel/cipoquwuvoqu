All four of the main characters are irritating and off-putting, particularly the uninhibited Andie, who says any vulgar or insensitive or inappropriate thing that comes into her head.</p><p>During an ultrasound examination, when the nurse applies some gel to her stomach, Andie announces, "It feels like I'm being jizzed on." When she breaks wind, Andie calls herself "Gaseous Clay," and after the ultrasound, she says, "Seriously, I feel like Clammy Davis, Jr." Lizzie laughs at Andie's feeble attempts at humor, and Andie even makes a point of saying that she loves Lizzie because "you get my jokes." But "Expecting" doesn't make it easy to know how we're supposed to view Andie. At one point, Lizzie says to Andie, "I need you to get the Tourette's under control," but it's unclear if she is being serious or not. Is there actually something a little bit wrong with Andie, or is she just a generally obnoxious and unfunny person?</p><p>Andie's wordplay thing is practically a disease in this movie, so that even Lizzie starts to do it, calling her friend "Fellatio Alger" when she catches Andie fellating a grateful Casey. As they get to know each other better, Andie keeps saying very cruel things to Casey, but he seems to find them charming. Finally everything comes to a boil as Andie gives birth, and she makes a drastic decision that doesn't seem to faze Lizzie all that much.</p><p>As presented in this movie, Andie is a seriously rude, mean, selfish person, but by the end it seems clear that we are supposed to view her as maybe a little outrageous but also worthy of love and attention. Anyone who behaved like Andie in real life would wind up being a pariah, but in "Expecting" she is finally seen as harmlessly kooky.</p><p>There is little else here but the unappealing main quartet of characters. <a href=#>Mimi Kennedy</a> has three scenes as a therapist treating Lizzie and Peter, and she brightens and enlivens this film considerably, but all too briefly. It is not a good idea to hire someone as talented as Kennedy and then give her almost nothing to do. Lizzie and Peter own a recalcitrant dog named Joyce who tries to run away before the film is over, and this bitch's flight is perfectly understandable.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46er6mdk6m2r7OMa2dqaw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./foods-of-the-world-mafia-sign-ups-301919.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Foods of the World Mafia - Sign ups</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bella-dose-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-29278-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bella Dose Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-movie-review-2023.html>Emily movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-george-net-worth.html>Paul George Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-gentry.html>Who is Teddy Gentry?
