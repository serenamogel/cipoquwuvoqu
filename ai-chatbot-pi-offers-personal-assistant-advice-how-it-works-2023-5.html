This means the bots are trained to generate text answers by analyzing large quantities of content available online.</p><p class=premium>In another conversation, I told Pi that I was considering graduate school, and that I worried about missing the application deadline.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Pi gave me advice on what to do if the deadline to apply to graduate school had passed. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Pi/Inflection AI</span></span></figure><p class=premium>Pi gave me advice on other options to consider, and asked how I could keep myself busy.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>The bot is designed to offer human-like support and advice, but also made clear that it's not actually human.</p><p class=premium>When I asked Pi how it was doing, it responded, "Well, as an AI I'm not really affected by the kind of things that stress humans out, but I am programmed to be empathetic and understanding.

Pi gave itself some autonomy by mentioning "my favorites," and included some museums "a little more off the beaten path."&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>In general, Pi kept our conversation flowing with follow-up questions. At one point I asked if I could restart our conversation. Pi said I could change topics, but didn't offer a full reset of our interaction.</p><p class=premium>An Inflection AI spokesperson later told me that users can't technically "restart" their conversations with Pi, unless they use different login credentials.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Insider asked Pi how to restart the conversation, and Pi said to "start talking about whatever is on your mind." <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Pi/Inflection AI</span></span></figure><p class=premium>Users can delete their accounts through the iPhone or iPad apps, or by sending an email request to Inflection AI with the phone number they used to register, the spokesperson said. Users can also request via email that Inflection AI delete its copy of conversations.</p><p class=premium>Pi has been trained on data as recent as November 2022, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>Forbes reported</a>. Details that can make a person identifiable are not used in the training, Suleyman told Bloomberg.</p><p class=premium>The chatbot is <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>currently free on a web browser or mobile download for iOS</a>, and prompts users to add a phone number after 10 interactions so Pi can text them to ask how they're doing. Users can text the chatbot "PAUSE" when they want to stop hearing from Pi. Pi is <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>also available</a> to DM on Instagram and Facebook Messenger, and to text on WhatsApp or SMS.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>Like <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>other AI chatbots</a>, Pi can make wrong or inaccurate statements. Inflection AI <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>said</a> it's working to "minimize hallucinations." Inflection AI also said it's "creating a new form of 'boundary training' that will redefine how AIs learn and are trained." Users can flag problematic conversations on the web browser and apps.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png alt="A picture of a switch and lightbulb" itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Sign up for notifications from Insider!
