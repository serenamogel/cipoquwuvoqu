— despite his pleas that she be kept on the island.</p><p>A judge Thursday granted Lindsay Shiver’s request to return to her young children in the US while she <a href=#>awaits the murder-for-hire trial,</a> which is anticipated to kick off in March.</p><p>She has been <a href=#>remanded to the island nation since July</a>, though allowed free from prison under the conditions that she wear an electric monitoring device and adhere to a curfew.</p><p>Shiver and her team told the court she feared for her “mental and physical safety” and begged that she be allowed to see her children, from whom she has been separated <a href=#>since her arrest</a>, according to Court TV.</p><p>Shiver, 36, will be allowed to return to her parents’ home in Alabama under the new ruling but must keep her ankle monitor on and will not be permitted to travel to Georgia, where she <a href=#>lived with her husband, Robert Shiver</a>, before allegedly asking her new beau to kill him.</p><figure
