the United States government's impending plan to invade Iraq – was one of the few tracks that were ever released.</p><p class=paragraph-text>In an interview <a href=# rel=noopener>with The

home, he eventually asked him to leave after overstaying his welcome.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"He started to hang out at the house all the time and I had to get up in the morning; I’m 12 years older than him, I had to take my kids to school," he said.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"At some point, I said: ‘Michael, wherever it is you’re going, you’ve got to go.’ So,” Barry laughs, “I politely asked Michael Jackson to leave my house because I couldn’t get anything else done.”</p><p class=paragraph-text>The interview comes after Barry had previously discussed his time with MJ and how fond he was of the star.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"<a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> and I were the dearest of friends, that's simply what it was," Barry said upon the release of the video for their duet in
