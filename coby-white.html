This season has taught me so much and I wouldn't trade the opportunity to play at UNC with a group of guys that have truly become my brothers for anything. These past 10 months have been the highlight of my basketball career and I've grown so much on and off the court. Thank you is not enough to show my gratitude to the best coaching staff. They pushed me and the entire team to be the best players we could be. I want to thank my brothers who I stepped in between those lines with me everyday. The growth we experienced by coming together, not only as team, but a real family made this year unforgettable. I know for certain, I can count on all of them no matter what…love y'all boys! Thank you to the fans that supported and motivated us through the wins and losses. I've always had a dream of playing basketball in the NBA and with that being said, I've decided to enter the 2019 NBA draft. This year, this school, this experience has prepared me for the next phase of my basketball journey. Again, thank you! Carolina will forever be my home! I will forever be a Tar Heel! This is not a goodbye, but until next time. Go Tar Heels! #FMF</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=#>Coby</a> (@cobywhite) on Apr 3, 2019 at 1:14pm PDT</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2>Coby White Highlights</h2><h2></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
