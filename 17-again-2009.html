Same wife, same kids, same problems. As Old Mike getting divorced, he'd moved in with his best friend, Ned (<a href=#>Thomas Lennon</a>), and now he throws himself on Ned's mercy: Will Ned pose as his father, so Young Mike can be his son and help out his kids by enrolling in the same high school again? Ned, who is a software millionaire and middle-age fanboy, agrees, especially after he falls helplessly in love with the high school principal, Jane (<a href=#>Melora Hardin</a>).</p><p>Young Mike becomes the new best friend of his insecure son, Alex (<a href=#>Sterling Knight</a>). Then he meets Alex's mom, Scarlet (<a href=#>Leslie Mann</a>), who, of course, before the vortex was his wife, and before that his high school bride (<a href=#>Allison Miller</a>). She thinks it's strange that he looks <i>exactly</i> like the boy she married at 17. He explains he is the son of an uncle, who I guess would have to be Old Mike's brother, so it's curious Old Scarlet never met him, but if she doesn't ask that, why should I?</p><p>In high school, Young Mike again becomes a basketball star, befriends Alex, and attempts to defend his Gothish daughter, Maggie (<a href=#>Michelle Trachtenberg</a>), against the predations of her jerk boyfriend, who as a hot-rodding jock traveling with a posse is, of course, the <i>last</i> guy in school who would date, or be dated by, a moody girl who wears black.</p><p>I've seen Body Switches before (<a href=#>Tom Hanks</a> in "Big"). The first act of this movie seemed all retread. Then it started to dig in. There are twin romances; as Shakespeare demonstrated, one must be serious and the other farcical. Young Mike is still seriously in love with his wife, Old Scarlet, and she is powerfully attracted to this boy who's a double for her first love. She thinks that's wrong. He knows it isn't but how can he explain?</p><p>Meanwhile, best buddy Ned courts Principal Masterson, who for the first time in his life has Taught Him What Love Means. Before her, ecstasy was owning Darth Vader's costume. I will not describe what happens the first time they go out to dinner, except to say that it's comic genius, perfectly played by Melora Hardin and Thomas Lennon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v45qbmaZl5a2r3mRaWdy</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./harper-finn-obituary-and-death-cause-accident.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Harper Finn Obituary And Death Cause Linked To Accident</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./coby-white.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Coby White Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Agents, Highlights, and Chicago Bulls</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-movie-review-2023.html>Emily movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-george-net-worth.html>Paul George Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-gentry.html>Who is Teddy Gentry?
