The unfortunate news was released by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mainichi</a>, which shared details on the case allegedly involving Ito, the producer of some of the most acclaimed animated films hailing from Japan in the last few years, including <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Your Name</a></strong>, and Weathering With You.</p><p data-characters=384 data-current-count=384 data-injectable=false>Disappointed fans all over the world have expressed their disbelief and outright shock at the news. However prevalent these types of sexual crimes might be in Japan, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we never truly expect them to come from one of our favorite creators</a>. While the case is still being investigated, the producer has already been taken into custody by authorities. Here are all the details for this case.</p><h2 id=h-why-was-koichiro-ito-arrested data-injectable=false>Why was Koichiro Ito arrested?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Suzume.jpg><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mainichi,</a> a Japanese news outlet, Koichiro Ito was accused of persuading a 15-year-old high school girl in Nagano Prefecture to send him nude images in September of 2021. The outlet reported that Ito initially contacted the student through social media, and allegedly was fully aware of her underage status. Investigators suspect there may be additional victims in this case.</p><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=875 data-injectable=true>“I had a similar exchange with another person, so I can’t remember if it was this girl or not,” Ito admitted to the police, leading authorities to believe that he may have been involved in more than one premeditated situation with another minor. The news outlet further informs that authorities are also investigating Ito in connection with a separate case involving child sex trafficking, though no additional information was provided in this specific news report.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>As it stands, Ito’s admission to having indeed communicated with minors allegedly indicates that the reported events are true, and that he confessed to purposefully influencing minors online. In an unfortunate turn of events, he is not the first nor will he be the last anime producer to be involved in sexual misconduct cases.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/violetheart08/status/1760539474923057178?s=20</figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Over the years, several manga authors have been arrested or fined due to indecent actions against minors, or for possessing CSAM. While we can’t attribute a specific reason to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan’s high number of sex crimes concerning children</a>, this particular crime does appear to follow an unfortunate pattern of allowing perpetrators to roam freely without sentence.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=true>In 2017, the author of the popular shonen manga Rurouni Kenshin was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">found to possess multiple videos at his home containing sexually-exploitative footage of underage girls</a>. Watsuki was fined ¥200,000, which is approximately $1,500, and was able to continue his work in manga freely. In 2020, a similar case occurred when manga author Tatsuya Matsuki was arrested for committing indecent acts with an underage teenager in Tokyo.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tatsuya Matsuki the author of Shonen Jump’s Act-Age was arrested for allegedly committing indecent acts against a teenage girl <a href=#>https://t.co/IJr83yK4sf</a></p>— YonkouProductions (@YonkouProd) <a href=#>August 8, 2020</a></figure><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=864 data-injectable=true>He was sentenced to one year and six months in prison; however, the sentence was suspended for three years. If, during that time, Matsuki does not commit any further indecent acts, he will not serve time in prison. Currently, Japan’s lenient laws regarding CSAM and sexual exploitation of children remains a concern for several residents. In 2023, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan raised the age of sexual consent</a> from 13 to 16 years old, and only in 2014 did <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the country ban the possession of child pornography</a> — making it one of the last developed countries in the world to do so.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=77 data-injectable=false>At the moment, there is still no information regarding Ito’s sentence.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>If you or someone you know if suffering from sexual exploitation or violence, contact&nbsp;<a href=#>RAINN</a>&nbsp;or the National Sexual Abuse Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn7Jlp5bAbsXOrqlmppGism680aibrpuVp3qsu8icn6Kqn2K2tbuMmqmrnaOpsqV506GcZpufo8Gzu9WeqayxXZa7pXnAnJquq5GptrC6jJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alec-monopoly-net-worth-272433.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alec Monopoly Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-seagulls-laughter-2004.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Seagull's Laughter movie review (2004)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-movie-review-2023.html>Emily movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-george-net-worth.html>Paul George Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-gentry.html>Who is Teddy Gentry?
