Hannibal Lecter is one of the most wicked villains in movie history, and one of the most beloved. We forgive him his trespasses because (1) they are forced upon him by his nature; (2) most of the time he is helplessly imprisoned, and providing aid to the FBI, or seeming to, after his peculiar fashion, and (3) he is droll and literate, dryly humorous, elegantly mannered. In these days of movie characters who obediently recite the words the plot requires of them, it's a pleasure to meet a man who can hold up his end of the conversation.</p><p>The opening, with Hannibal still in civilian life, allows a tense early scene in which the doctor (<a href=#>Anthony Hopkins</a>) receives a late-night visitor, FBI agent Will Graham (<a href=#>Edward Norton</a>). Graham has been assisted by Lecter in examining a series of crimes which, he has just realized, involved cannibalism--and now, as he regards the doctor in the gloom of the shadowed study, it occurs to him, just as it simultaneously occurs to Lecter, that it is clear to both of them who this cannibal might be.</p><p>Flash forward several years. Lecter is in prison, Graham has taken early retirement, but now his old FBI boss (<a href=#>Harvey Keitel</a>) wants to recruit him to solve a pair of serial killings, this time by a man dubbed the Tooth Fairy because he leaves an unmistakable dental imprint at the scenes of his crimes. Graham resists, but photos of the dead families and a poignant look at his own living family do the trick, and he joins the case as a free-lance adviser. This requires him to examine crime scenes by creeping through them in pitch darkness in the middle of the night, although there is no reason he could not visit at noon (except, of course, that he wants to share the killer's point of view, and also because the film seeds the darkness with potential danger).</p><p>The director is <a href=#>Brett Ratner</a>, who has not achieved the distinction of the three previous directors of Hannibal Lecter movies (<a href=#>Jonathan Demme</a> on "<a href=#>The Silence of the Lambs</a>," <a href=#>Ridley Scott</a> on "<a href=#>Hannibal</a>," and <a href=#>Michael Mann</a> on "Manhunter," the first version of "Red Dragon," made in 1986). Ratner's credits have included the "<a href=#>Rush Hour</a>" pictures, "Family Man" and "<a href=#>Money Talks</a>," some with their merits, none suggesting he was qualified to be Lecter's next director.</p><p>To my surprise, he does a sure, stylish job, appreciating the droll humor of Lecter's predicament, creating a depraved new villain in the Tooth Fairy (<a href=#>Ralph Fiennes</a>), and using the quiet, intense skills of Norton to create a character whose old fears feed into his new ones. There is also humor, of the uneasy he-can't-get-away-with-this variety, in the character of a nosy scandal-sheet reporter (<a href=#>Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>). The screenplay by <a href=#>Ted Tally</a>, who wrote "Lambs," also supplies a blind girl in peril (<a href=#>Emily Watson</a>), and blind girls have worked dependably since the days of silent pictures.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46rnJ1llKeuqLvNZmlpaGI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-best-connie-britton-tv-shows-and-movies-ranked.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 best Connie Britton TV shows and movies, ranked</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carla-gugino.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carla Gugino Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-movie-review-2023.html>Emily movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-george-net-worth.html>Paul George Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-gentry.html>Who is Teddy Gentry?
