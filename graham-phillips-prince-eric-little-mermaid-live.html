Who among us hasn't had a giant crush on Prince Eric since before they knew what a crush even was? Well, are you ready to fall in love with Ariel's prince once more? You better be because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wonderful World of Disney Presents The Little Mermaid Live!</a> cast an actor that's pretty hard not to love.&nbsp;</p><p>Meet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Graham Phillips</a>, the new Prince Eric in The Little Mermaid Live!, although you may have seen this child actor turned TV and Broadway star before.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Graham Phillips, Prince Eric of The Little Mermaid Live!, has been singing and acting his whole life.</h2><p>If you're questioning whether Graham can handle the role of Prince Eric, it's important to realize that the more important question is, "What can't Graham handle?"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY</span></figure><p>The 26-year-old singer and actor's first role was in King of Queens in 2002. Graham has had a number of TV credits since then, including White Collar, The Good Wife, and Secrets and Lies. Most recently, he's been seen in Riverdale and Atypical. While adding to his television resume, Graham was also in a number of films including Goats, XOXO, and Blockers.</p><p>But the stage was really where Graham got his start. He had several ensemble roles before landing the title role of The Little Prince at Lincoln Center. After playing the prince, he went onto play Young Clyde at the Metropolitan Opera, which he was charged with opening and closing with a solo every night. The young singer 's talent was even noticed by Meat Loaf, who had him as a soloist on his 2006 album Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose.</p><p>In 2008, Graham originated the role of Evan Goldman, the central character of Broadway's 13. Graham remained in 13 until the show's closing in 2009. 13 also happens to have starred Ariana Grande, who Graham dated from 2008 to 2011.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So what's Graham doing in The Little Mermaid Live!?</h2><p>Graham was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced to have joined The Little Mermaid Live! cast in September</a>, at the same time as it was announced that John Stamos would be playing Chef Louis, a character he previously played in The Little Mermaid‘s 2016 Hollywood Bowl production of the show.</p><p>Graham will be playing Prince Eric opposite Auli’i Cravalho's Ariel, while Queen Latifah plays the conniving Ursula. The Little Mermaid Live! is the first live theatrical performance that will be played on ABC. The performance comes after the success that FOX and NBC have had with their live shows, like Grease: Live and Hairspray Live!.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: GETTY</span></figure><p>We're looking forward to falling in love with Prince Eric all over again, although we are hoping that ABC takes advantage of his Broadway-honed voice and gives him the solo that Prince Eric never had. But we'll just have to wait and see! Catch Graham and the rest of The Little Mermaid Live! cast on ABC on Nov. 5 at 8/7c.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnL%2BitMCmZKmgmaG5qrzSZqeroZ6Ysm6x0aKaZqSZqcGtsYymnKulkZ6xbrjIr5w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jaden-smith-takes-fan-ridicule-on-the-chin-memes-himself.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jaden Smith takes fan ridicule on the chin; memes himself</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-blackwell-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Blackwell Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-movie-review-2023.html>Emily movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-george-net-worth.html>Paul George Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-gentry.html>Who is Teddy Gentry?
