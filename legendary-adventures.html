They overhear some <a href=# title="Team Break">Team Break</a> <a href=# title="Masked Man (Trainer class)">masked men</a> discuss how strong the Trainer is and wonder whether they can make him their boss. However, one of them reveals that he had previously stated not being interested as he was already leader of <a href=# title="Team Rainbow Rocket">Team Rainbow Rocket</a>. Brock and Misty interrupt their conversation and Misty realizes that this must mean that Giovanni has come to <a href=# title=Pasio>Pasio</a>. Brock explains to the player that Giovanni is the leader of <a href=# title="Team Rocket">Team Rocket</a> in <a href=# title=Kanto>Kanto</a>. They decide to stop him but the Team Break thugs try to stop them and start a battle. After being defeated, the masked men leave.</p><p>Brock, Misty and the player head into the cave where Giovanni is. After some time, they eventually find him. Misty confronts Giovanni asking what he is up to despite Team Rocket having being disbanded. Giovanni is surprised that Team Rocket is disbanded and guesses he is doomed to be a criminal no matter which world he is in.</p><p>Giovanni reveals he was able to mine a <a href=# title="Sync stone">sync stone</a> from the cave. He reveals his aim to bend the power of the sync stone to his will and to unleash the hidden power in them. He brings out Mewtwo and battles them to see what the sync stone is capable of.</p><p>After the battle, Giovanni sees that it is possible for the bond of a sync pair to manifest great strength. Brock doubts Giovanni will give up on seeking power and believes he was not treating that as a serious battle. Giovanni remarks that the battle was a test run. He dares the player to follow him to for a rematch and then disappears with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>The player finally corners Giovanni in a cave. He admits being impressed with the team's full power and asks whether they would like to work with him. Brock does not want to get involved with his evil schemes. Giovanni understands their doubts and states he has been thinking about changing his ways and starting afresh in this new part of the world. Both Brock and Misty are skeptical but Brock suggests that the player could keep an eye on Giovanni by letting him join the team. Giovanni promises not to get involved with Team Break and just to enjoy the <a href=# title="Pokémon Masters League">PML</a>. As they leave, Giovanni reflects that he has been able to infiltrate their unit successfully and is still deciding whether to truly start afresh or to plan something else.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Area_info>Area info</span></h3><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battles>Battles</span></h3><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Shop>Shop</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Pure_Hearts_and_Rainbow_Wings>Pure Hearts and Rainbow Wings</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/aa/Masters_Pure_Hearts_Rainbow_Wings_artwork.jpg/300px-Masters_Pure_Hearts_Rainbow_Wings_artwork.jpg decoding=async width=200 height=200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Artwork by hncl<p>This story was added to Legendary Adventures on December 4, 2021.

Ethan decides to follow it, and he has Silver recruit the <a href=# title="Player character">player</a> to join them.</p><p>The player meets up with Ethan and Silver, and Ethan formally introduces Silver to the player. Silver is skeptical that they would be able to track down Ho-Oh all over Pasio, but Ethan thinks of someone they can ask for information on the <a href=# title="Legendary Pokémon">Legendary Pokémon</a> and runs off, with the other two following. Meanwhile, a group of Team Break members plot to find and catch Ho-Oh.</p><p>Ethan looks for one of the <a href=# title="Kimono Girl">Kimono Girls</a> from <a href=# title=Johto>Johto</a> for information on Ho-Oh, and he spots <a href=# title="Valerie (Masters)">Valerie</a> talking to <a href=# title="Lance (Masters)">Lance</a>. She explains that she is not one of the Kimono Girls, but she does know about Ho-Oh. She notes the tension between Silver and Lance before describing some of the legends about Ho-Oh, and she suggests that it might be found at high elevations, based on its history with the <a href=# title="Bell Tower">Bell Tower</a> and <a href=# title="Burned Tower">Burned Tower</a>. She also advises that Ho-Oh will only reveal itself to purehearted Trainers. Ethan is excited to climb one of Pasio's mountains to search, but Silver declines and leaves. That evening, Silver muses on the beach that Ho-Oh would never appear before him.</p><p>Lance joins Silver on the beach, and he remarks that Silver has changed since the first time they met; as evident by Silver's relationship with his <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Silver's Sneasel">Sneasel</a>, he has learned to value Pokémon as more than tools for battle and to bond with them. Silver rejects this, remembering his history and bringing to mind his father, <a href=# title=Giovanni>Giovanni</a>. Lance replies that Silver should believe in himself and tells him to make sure to meet up with Ethan and the player the next day. In the morning, Ethan tells Valerie and the player that Silver always shows up where he is because they are rivals. Silver finally arrives, and when they hear Ho-Oh's cry, Ethan takes off with Valerie, while Silver teams up with the player to climb the mountain to search. Team Break follows behind the group.</p><p>Later in the day, Silver notes that they still have not seen Ho-Oh, though they keep hearing its cry. He tells the player Ethan's passion used to aggravate him, but not anymore. They hear Ho-Oh again, and it comes down the mountain path to confront them. Silver intends to challenge Ho-Oh, but he gets a call from Ethan, who tells him Team Break is chasing him and Valerie and asks Silver to come help. Silver is torn between forfeiting his chance to battle Ho-Oh and leaving Ethan to fend for himself. Ethan tries to hold off the Team Break members with his <a href=# title="Cyndaquil (Pokémon)">Cyndaquil</a>, but when Team Break is about to rush them, Silver's Sneasel jumps in. Silver taunts Team Break for ganging up on Trainers.</p><p>Ethan and Silver take out the rest of Team Break's Pokémon together, but their leader calls in reinforcements. Silver declares that he will continue to fight all opponents with the Pokémon he has trained, as his goal is to be the world's greatest Trainer,and the rest of the group give their support. Team Break prepares to rush them, but Ho-Oh's arrival prompts them to switch their focus to it instead. Ho-Oh drives them off with its flames, and when it does not fly off afterwards, Ethan believes it wants to join with one of them. Silver separates from the group, not wanting to see Ho-Oh join one of the others, but when Ethan calls him back, Silver sees Ho-Oh approaching him. Silver reluctantly accepts Ethan's praise, and he approaches Ho-Oh to join as a sync pair.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Area_info_2>Area info</span></h3><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Battles_2>Battles</span></h3><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Shop_2>Shop</span></h3><h2><span class=mw-headline id=The_Dragon_That_Rules_the_Sky>The Dragon That Rules the Sky</span></h2><p>This story was added to Legendary Adventures on December 14, 2021.
