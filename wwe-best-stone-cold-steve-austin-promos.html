That didn't stop him from charming audiences at home as he energetically screamed "Gimme a Hell Yeah!" to a silent arena, then began reading the rules to his new holiday, 3:16 Day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Austin eventually turned his attention towards commentator Byron Saxton, who inevitably ended up taking a Stunner.

It was here that Austin admitted to Rocky that he didn't just want to win...he "needed" to win.

The Rattlesnake made this point loud and clear during an edition of Monday Night Raw back in 2002, where he spoke with Michael Cole about the upcoming Royal Rumble, and how much harder it would be for opponents to eliminate him with a beer belly.</p><p>Austin later tells a story of riding a mechanical bull in every direction humanly possible before telling the rabid Dallas fans that he looks forward to having a "What...What...Whataburger," a hilarious line that quickly resonated with the Texas faithful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=face-off-with-tyson-serious><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Face-Off With Tyson (Serious)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Stone-Cold-Tyson.jpg><p>The pull-apart brawl between Austin and boxing legend Iron Mike Tyson in 1998 has become one of the defining highlights of the Attitude Era, and one of the pivotal moments in the well-documented Monday Night Wars.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:</span></p><p><a href=#>5 Best Celebrities Who Appeared In The Attitude Era (And The 5 Worst)</a></p><p>At the time Tyson was considered the baddest man on the planet, but Austin, fresh off his second Royal Rumble win, showed no fear.

Ahead of their showdown, Jericho decided to bring out a fake overweight Stone Cold to mock, and boy did the Rattlesnake make that poor lookalike pay.</p><p>Austin would hilariously berate fake Stone Cold for several minutes, pointing out each similarity they shared before finally putting him out of his misery with a Stunner.

To cap things off...Austin truly believed that he was the company's world champion, later exclaiming that there "ain't nobody that was going to tell him different."</p><h2 id=the-stupid-undertaker-funny><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Stupid Undertaker (Funny)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stone-Cold-vs-Undertaker-amazonaws.jpg><p>The Undertaker has always been one of Stone Cold's greatest opponents, but he stood no chance against the Rattlesnake during a 2002 edition of Monday Night Raw, especially in his biker form.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Deadman had been pleading with GM Ric Flair to name him as the #1 contender for the WWE Championship, a move that prompted Austin to come out and give Taker a piece of his mind. He did just that, calling Taker stupid from head to toe, and even promising to steal Taker's stupid motorcycle. This may have been Austin's best "What" exchange ever.</p><h2 id=threatening-donald-trump-serious><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Threatening Donald Trump (Serious)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/stunner-trump.jpg><p>After his in-ring career came to an end Austin shifted to an on-screen authority figure, and in 2007 was named the special guest referee for one of WrestleMania 23's most marquee matchups, the Battle of the Billionaires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The bout saw Umaga, representing Vince McMahon, battle Bobby Lashley, who represented Apprentice star and future U.S. President Donald Trump. During the matchup's contract signing Austin calmly warned Trump not to ruffle his feathers, otherwise, he'd be served with an 8-billion dollar can of whoop-ass.
