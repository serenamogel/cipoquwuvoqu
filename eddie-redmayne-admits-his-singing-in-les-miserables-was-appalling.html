Technically, it’s appallingly sung, but it’s got like a fragility that helps sell the song.”</p><p data-characters=678 data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true>The actor also went on to thoroughly recall the filming process of that particular rendition of the song, admitting that he much preferred focusing on an emotional performance as a mourning Marius over vocal precision. Redmayne also admits he took on the approach upon watching closely Robert De Niro’s work ethics, sharing that “De Niro has this process where he’s filming, and you’d do a take, an emotional take, and then he would stop you and get you to go back and start again, and take the accumulation of that emotion and repress that and fire that back into the start of a scene, and that’s what we did here on this piece eventually.”.</p><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=361 data-injectable=false>The song, which is a little over three minutes long, apparently took more takes than one would’ve expected. “I’m going to go until I can’t go anymore,” he admitted. “Because at least when you’re not happy with what you end up seeing, you know that you went for it. We did that there. We did push it pretty far.”.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>The emotive and raw performances from Redmayne’s co-star Anne Hathaway granted the actress an Oscar for her role as the unfortunate and pitiful Fantine, and a nomination for Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean. Although Redmayne wouldn’t be awarded any Academy Awards for bringing life to Marius, he would get his first Oscar nomination and win in 2015 with his stellar performance in The Theory of Everything.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>This fall, Redmayne can be found in Netflix’s newest psychological thriller, The Good Nurse, which will have its premiere on Oct. 26, this time with a more than promising rendition, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">if the rave reviews are anything to go by.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonJ2cmZp6s7HDppiyppVirqW5yK2qZqCZqHq0tc2goKefXZ67brjErGSmoaOav6Kuy56qZq%2BRqHqivM%2Bao6Whnpx8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./og-nova-death-why-is-the-video-trending-on-tiktok-564699-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>OG Nova Death: Why Is The Video Trending On Tiktok?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-ryan-fox-net-worth-183573.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sean Ryan Fox Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./emily-movie-review-2023.html>Emily movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paul-george-net-worth.html>Paul George Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-times-drama-honor-crossword-clue-answer-1176428.html>LA Times Drama honor Crossword Clue Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./teddy-gentry.html>Who is Teddy Gentry?
